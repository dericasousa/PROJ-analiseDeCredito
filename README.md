# Credit Approval Classification




## Describe Project

The Machine Learning project for Credit Prediction uses the "Credit Card Approval Clean Data" dataset from the UCI Machine Learning repository to train and test a model capable of predicting whether a person will be successful in applying for a credit card. Data analysis is performed to identify patterns and trends in the data, followed by training of classification algorithms to predict outcomes based on the characteristics of the credit card applicants. The goal of this project is to help financial institutions make more informed decisions about credit approval.
## Objectives

The objective is to classify whether a person is approved or not for credit.
